      <p>Niépce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the
        light-sensitive silver halides, which Niépce had abandoned many years earlier
        because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast
        and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the
        daguerreotype process. The essential elements—a silver-plated surface sensitized
        by iodine vapor, developed by mercury vapor, and "fixed" with hot saturated salt
        water—were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes
        instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in
        1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and
        horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having
        his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long
        exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced,
        without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation.
        France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his
        invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working
        instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer
        Robert Cornelius is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.</p>

      <h2>Travelling</h2>
      <hr size="5" noshade width="150" align="left">
      <p>The origin of the word "travel" is most likely lost to history. The term "travel" may originate
        from the Old French word travail, which means 'work'.According to the Merriam Webster
        dictionary, the first known use of the word travel was in the 14th century. It also states
        that the word comes from Middle English travailen, travelen (which means to torment,
        labor, strive, journey) and earlier from Old French travailler (which means to work strenuously, toil).
        In English we still occasionally use the words "travail", which means struggle. According to
        Simon Winchester in his book The Best Travelers' Tales (2004), the words "travel" and "travail"
        both share an even more ancient root: a Roman instrument of torture called the tripalium
        (in Latin it means "three stakes", as in to impale). This link may reflect the extreme difficulty
        of travel in ancient times. Travel in modern times may or may not be much easier depending upon
        the destination. Travel to Mount Everest, the Amazon rainforest, extreme tourism, and adventure
        travel are more difficult forms of travel. Travel can also be more difficult depending on the
        method of travel, such as by bus, cruise ship, or even by bullock cart</p>

      <p>Unlike most sports, mountaineering lacks widely-applied formal rules, regulations, and governance;
        mountaineers adhere to a large variety of techniques and philosophies when climbing mountains.
        Numerous local alpine clubs support mountaineers by hosting resources and social activities.
        A federation of alpine clubs, the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA),
        is the International Olympic Committee-recognized world organization for mountaineering and climbing</p>

      <p>A film, also called a movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a work of visual art used to
        simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere
        through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely,
        other sensory stimulations.[1] The word "cinema", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to
        filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. The moving images of a
        film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion-picture camera, by photographing drawings
        or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or
        by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects.</p>
